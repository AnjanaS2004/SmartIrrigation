# ML-Powered Smart Irrigation System

A real-time, zone-specific irrigation management tool using Machine Learning to minimize water usage and enhance crop productivity. Built with Python and Streamlit, this system provides an interactive interface for decision-making based on live sensor inputs.

## 🔍 Project Summary

This project simulates a smart irrigation setup that monitors key environmental variables—such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and more—across different zones of an agricultural field. A trained ML model processes this data to determine whether irrigation is required in each zone and controls the sprinklers accordingly.

Users can adjust sensor values via a Streamlit interface and receive instant predictions on sprinkler activity.
